# External Host Configuration
# This IP address should be set to the host machine's IP address that can be accessed from outside the Docker network
# It's used for the AAS Web UI and other services that need to be accessed externally
EXTERNAL_HOST=192.168.0.104

# MQTT Broker Configuration
# For services running inside Docker on the same host, use the container name (hivemq-broker)
# For services running outside Docker or on different hosts, use the IP address of the Docker host
MQTT_BROKER=hivemq-broker
MQTT_PORT=1883

# When running services OUTSIDE the Docker network (e.g., on a different machine),
# uncomment and set these to the Docker host's IP:
# MQTT_BROKER=192.168.0.140
# MQTT_PORT=1883

# BaSyx Configuration
# For services running inside Docker on the same host, use container names
# For external services, use the EXTERNAL_HOST IP

# DISTRIBUTED DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLE
# =============================================================================
# When deploying bt_controller on a DIFFERENT machine that needs to reach
# services running on the main Docker host (192.168.0.140), create a local
# .env file with these settings:
#
# MQTT_BROKER=192.168.0.140
# AAS_SERVER=192.168.0.140
# AAS_REGISTRY=192.168.0.140
